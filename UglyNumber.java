// An ugly number is a positive integer which does not have a prime factor other than 2, 3, and 5.
// Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

// Example 1:
// Input: n = 6
// Output: true
// Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
  
// Example 2:
// Input: n = 1
// Output: true
// Explanation: 1 has no prime factors.
  
// Example 3:
// Input: n = 14
// Output: false
// Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 
// Constraints:
// -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

class UglyNumber {
    // To check if an Number is Ugly or not,
    // 1. If the number is less than or equal to 0, it's not considered an ugly number.
    // 2. Divide the number by 2 as long as it is divisible by 2.
    // 3. Divide the number by 3 as long as it is divisible by 3.
    // 4. Divide the number by 5 as long as it is divisible by 5.
    // 5. If the resulting number is 1, then the original number is an ugly number because its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. Otherwise, it's not an ugly number.
