// Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
// There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
// Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
// Do not modify the linked list.

// Example 1:
// Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
// Output: tail connects to node index 1
// Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

// Example 2:
// Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
// Output: tail connects to node index 0
// Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

// Example 3:
// Input: head = [1], pos = -1
// Output: no cycle
// Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 
// Constraints:
// The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
// -105 <= Node.val <= 105
// pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
